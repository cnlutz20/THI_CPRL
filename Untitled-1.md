H.B. 2794: Modifies provisions governing postsecondary plans of elementary and secondary school students

HCS HB 2794 -- POSTSECONDARY PLANS OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY
STUDENTS

SPONSOR: Bangert

COMMITTEE ACTION: Voted "Do Pass with HCS" by the Standing
Committee on Workforce and Infrastructure Development by a vote of
10 to 1. Voted "Do Pass" by the Standing Committee on Rules-
Administrative Oversight by a vote of 6 to 0.

The following is a summary of the House Committee Substitute for HB
2794.

This bill requires that students in the eighth grade complete a
career assessment, meet with a school counselor, and develop a
personal plan of study or individual career and academic plan
(ICAP). Beginning in the 2025-26 school year students in ninth
through 12th grade must annually review and complete the ICAP with
the assistance of a teacher or counselor.

For Kindergarten through grade twelve, instruction in career
literacy must be through lessons provided through the comprehensive
school counseling program, Missouri Connections, or a comparable
resource and must include no fewer than six lessons for
Kindergarten through grade two; no fewer than eight for grades
three through five; and no fewer than 10 for grades six to 12.

The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education must provide
each local education agency with updated career literacy resources
by August first of each year; monitor the integration and
implementation of the activities through student ICAP completion
data; and establish an online portfolio process for student
tracking and a collaborative process to help students align with
graduation requirements, personal interests, labor market needs,
and career goals. The bill specifies career and educational
opportunities in which the Department will educate students.

The bill repeals the "Career Readiness Course Task Force" section;
the task force was dissolved in 2019.

The following is a summary of the public testimony from the
committee hearing. The testimony was based on the introduced
version of the bill.

PROPONENTS: Supporters say that counselors are stretched now with
issues other than careers. The career readiness task force found
8th grade the ideal year for career literacy, but had a time
challenge for mounting a semester-length course. Like a similar
bill in Indiana, this bill shares career awareness development
across all grades in smaller increments of time.

Testifying in person for the bill was Representative Bangert.

OPPONENTS: There was no opposition voiced to the committee.

H.B. 2148: Specifies that a parent's obligation to pay child support terminates when the child turns 18 or graduates from high school, whichever occurs later, with certain exceptions

HCS HB 2148 -- TERMINATION OF CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS

SPONSOR: Dinkins

COMMITTEE ACTION: Voted "Do Pass with HCS" by the Standing
Committee on Emerging Issues by a vote of 13 to 0. Voted "Do Pass"
by the Standing Committee on Rules- Legislative Oversight by a vote
of 9 to 0.

The following is a summary of the House Committee Substitute for HB
2148.

Currently, a parent's obligation to pay child support terminates
when the child reaches 18 years of age unless the child is enrolled
in and attending a secondary school program of instruction and
other specified criteria are met, in which case the support
obligation terminates when the child reaches 21 years of age.
Beginning with court orders issued on or after January 1, 2025,
this bill specifies that a parent's obligation to pay child support
terminates when a child reaches 18 years of age or receives a high
school diploma or certificate of graduation, which ever occurs
later, unless the child is physically or mentally incapacitated
from supporting himself or herself and insolvent and unmarried.

The bill additionally provides that for orders issued on or after
January 1, 2025, if child support is awarded, there must be a
rebuttable presumption in cases in which joint physical custody has
been awarded where the child or children spend equal or
substantially equal time with both parents that the calculation of
child support begins with a 50% credit for overnight visitation or
custody adjustment below the basic amount of child support
authorized.

This bill is similar to HB 73 (2023) and HB 1557 (2018).

The following is a summary of the public testimony from the
committee hearing. The testimony was based on the introduced
version of the bill.

PROPONENTS: Supporters say that this legislation provides much
needed updates to child support law. The age of 18 is recognized
as the threshold of adulthood. It follows that we should recognize
these individuals as financially independent. Ending child support
at the current age of 21 can delay development of responsibility in
young adults. Ending child support at age 18 provides a clear and
fair endpoint to the financial responsibility of the individual's
parents and ensures these young adults begin to care for
themselves.
Testifying in person for the bill were Representative Dinkins; Jeff
Miller, Americans For Equal Shared Parenting & The Lead Lobbyists;
and The L.E.A.D. Lobbyists (Learn.Educate.Advocate.Duplicate); and
Arnie C. Dienoff.

OPPONENTS: There was no opposition voiced to the committee.

Written testimony has been submitted for this bill. The full
written testimony and witnesses testifying online can be found

HCS HBs 1777, 2203, 2059 & 2502 -- CERTAIN OFFENDERS (Perkins)

COMMITTEE OF ORIGIN: Standing Committee on Corrections and Public
Institutions

This bill modifies several provisions relating to certain
offenders, including access to SNAP benefits; inmate release from
Department of Corrections; restraints on children in juvenile
court; pregnant offenders; and admissibility of certain evidence in
criminal cases.

ACCESS TO SNAP BENEFITS (Section 208.247)

The bill repeals current provisions of law allowing for individuals
convicted of certain drug offenses to participate in SNAP only if
certain conditions are met. Under this bill, individuals who are
convicted of a state or federal felony drug offense shall not be
excluded from SNAP for such conviction.

RESTRAINTS ON CHILDREN IN JUVENILE COURT (Section 211.436)

This bill prohibits the use of instruments of restraint on a child
during a juvenile court proceeding and it requires the instruments
to be removed prior to the child's appearance before the court
unless the court finds that certain exceptions, specified in the
bill, apply. If the juvenile office believes there is an immediate
safety or flight risk, the juvenile officer must advise the child's
attorney and make a written request prior to the commencement of
the proceeding for the child to remain restrained during the
proceeding. The child's attorney will have an opportunity to be
heard and, if restraints are ordered, the court will make findings
of fact in support of the order.

INMATE RELEASE FROM CORRECTIONS (Section 217.443)

This bill requires the Department of Corrections to provide certain
inmates, as specified in the bill, with relevant documentation to
assist in obtaining post-release employment.

The Department shall coordinate with the Department of Revenue to
provide a State-issued identification card if the inmate does not
have a current one.

Nine months prior to an inmate's release from custody, the
Department of Corrections shall determine whether the inmate has a
current State ID and, if not, begin gathering the required
documentation to receive one.
State-issued ID cards issued with a record card from the Department
of Corrections shall be valid for a period of four years and are
nonrenewable.

The Department of Corrections may utilize any funds to cover the
purchase of ID cards, including but not limited to, inmate trust
funds, existing funds of the Department, and donations.

The Department shall provide an inmate with the types of
documentation specified in the bill.

PREGNANT OFFENDERS (Sections 221.520 and 221.523)

This bill prohibits all county and city jails, except in
extraordinary circumstances, from using restraints on a pregnant
offender in her third trimester, including during transportation or
labor, delivery, and 48 hours post-delivery. Pregnant offenders
are required to be transported in vehicles equipped with seatbelts.
In cases of extraordinary circumstances that require restraints to
be used, the sheriff or jailer shall document, in writing and
within 48 hours of the incident, the reason for the restraints
used, as specified in the bill.

If restraints are used, they shall be the least restrictive
available and the most reasonable under the circumstances. No leg,
ankle, or waist restraints, or mechanical restraints shall be used;
any wrist restraints used shall be placed in front of the
offender's body.

Jails shall offer staff training on the provisions of this bill and
inform offenders of the policies and practices developed under this
bill.

By January 1, 2025, all county and city jails shall develop
specific procedures for intake and care of pregnant offenders,
including the provision of maternal health evaluations; dietary
supplements; meals; substance abuse treatment; HIV treatment;
Hepatitis C treatment; sleeping arrangements; mental health care;
sanitary materials; and postpartum recovery.

ADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL CASES (Sections
491.075 and 492.304)

Currently, a statement made by a child under 14 years of age may be
admissible in criminal proceedings, under certain circumstances.
This bill amends the age to a child under 18 years of age.

Additionally, the bill provides that visual or audio recordings of
a child under 18 years of age or a vulnerable person, as defined in
the bill, and relating to certain criminal offenses shall be
admissible in criminal proceedings under certain circumstances, as
is specified in the bill.

GOOD TIME CREDIT (Section 558.041)

This bill modifies provisions authorizing offenders committed to
the Department of Corrections to receive good time credit. Good
time credit is time that once earned, shall be subtracted from the
offender's minimum eligibility-for-release date.

This bill provides that the accumulation of good time credit does
not require that the offender be released; the parole board retains
discretion to determine the date of release. The parole board in
its discretion shall determine the date of release.

The bill provides that any major conduct violation or the
accumulation of minor conduct violations exceeding six in one year
will result in the loss of all credit earned. No offender who has
been sentenced to death or life without probation or parole is
eligible for good time credit.

The Department shall award credit of between five and 365 days for
programs and activities to any qualifying offender who
successfully:

(1) Receives a high school diploma or equivalent, college diploma,
or a vocational training certificate;

(2) Completes an alcohol or drug abuse treatment program,
excluding those treatment programs ordered by either the court or
parole board;

(3) Completes 1,000 hours of restorative justice; or

(4) Completes other programs provided under the Department's
policy.

No offender shall be eligible for more than 90 days of good time
credit per calendar year.

MANDATORY MINIMUM PRISON TERMS (Sections 558.019, 566.030, 566.060,
566.125, and 566.210)

Currently, if an offender has one previous prison commitment to the
Department of Corrections for a felony offense, the minimum prison
term is 40% of the sentence. If an offender has two previous
prison commitments to the Department of Corrections for felony
offenses, the minimum prison term is 50% of the sentence. If an
offender has three previous prison commitments to the Department of
Corrections the minimum prison term is 80% of the sentence.

This bill repeals these provisions, requiring any offender with one
or two prior felony convictions to serve 50% of the sentence
imposed by the court; and any offender with three or more prior
felony convictions to serve 80% of the sentence.

HCS#2 HB 2184 -- ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES FOR SCHOOLS

SPONSOR: Haffner

COMMITTEE ACTION: Voted "Do Pass with HCS" by the Standing
Committee on Elementary and Secondary Education by a vote of 13 to
2. Voted "To Return to Committee of Origin by the Standing
Committee on Rules- Administrative Oversight by a vote of 10 to 0.
Voted "Do Pass with HCS No. 2" by the Standing Committee on
Elementary and Secondary Education by a vote of 12 to 2. Voted "Do
Pass" by the Standing Committee on Rules- Regulatory Oversight by a
vote of 9 to 0.

The following is a summary of the House Committee Substitute NO. 2
for HB 2184.

This bill adds student growth to the categories of information
required to be included in the school accountability report cards
of all school districts, public schools, and public charter schools
under current law. The bill describes how student growth shall be
calculated, with reference to a comparison of students' performance
on statewide assessments in the current academic year to their
performance in prior years.

By July 15 of each year, the Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education (DESE) must provide a confidential version of the school
accountability report cards to each school building, school
district, and charter school. By August 15 of each year, DESE must
publish the school accountability report cards on the DESE website,
and each school building and school district must publish its
report card on its website. By August 15 of each year, DESE must
include in its annual budget request sufficient resources in
personnel and equipment to prepare the report cards.

Beginning with the 2026-27 school year and in all subsequent school
years, the bill also establishes provisions relating to the
preparation of annual performance ratings for public schools based
on students' academic performance. The bill specifies a
methodology for calculating the annual performance ratings for
elementary and secondary schools and school districts based on
students' year-to-year academic growth and achievement. For
elementary schools, year-to-year student growth and overall student
achievement shall each be weighted at 50% in the calculation, as
specified in the bill. For secondary schools, DESE will create a
college and career readiness measure that is based on statistical
models that identify schools' contributions to students' long-term
outcomes separately from their prior achievement. Certain factors
will be considered by DESE when measuring college and career
readiness, such as Advanced Placement scores and International
Baccalaureate program scores. For secondary schools, 60% of the
annual performance rating score shall be based on a combination of
the attainment of college and career readiness credentials and
student growth, as described in the bill, and 40% of the score
based on a combination of student achievement on end-of-course
exams and the five-year high school gradation rate.

Each school that has students who are enrolled in the school for
the full academic year and who are tested using the statewide
assessments receive an annual performance rating score and an
annual report card. However, a school does not earn an annual
performance rating score based on students' academic performance if
fewer than 10 students are tested in the statewide assessments.

Rules to implement the provisions of this bill will be promulgated
by DESE and will additionally have the authority to promulgate
rules including incentives or rewards for schools and school
districts that receive an annual performance rating score of 90% or
more or that increase their score by 10% over a three-year period.

The following is a summary of the public testimony from the
committee hearing. The testimony was based on the introduced
version of the bill.

PROPONENTS: Supporters say that this bill will provide an emphasis
on growth and measures what matters most. Adding a value-added
growth model is important as it truly measures not just achievement
but anticipated growth for individual students. Schools should be
held accountable if the students in the district are not achieving
at the level anticipated and when students struggle the future is
impacted. Providing information to parents is important and this
bill will help parents become more aware of how their child is
performing.

Testifying in person for the bill were Representative Haffner;
Aligned; Quality Schools Coalition; Danielle Holcomb; Jillian
Raining Bird; and Tricia McGhee, Revolucion Educativa.

OPPONENTS: Those who oppose the bill say that while it is
important to see discussion on accountability, having that
accountability being tied to an end of the year test misses the
mark. There are ways to make report cards clearer and there is an
issue with districts and parents not being able to see the test as
there is no transparency. The current accreditation system factors
in more than just a test score as schools are doing more than just
academics and deserve credit for the areas that cannot be tested.

Testifying in person against the bill were Armorvine; Keith D.
Smith, Kansas City Public Schools; Missouri NEA; Coop School
Districts of Greater Kansas City; and the Missouri Council of
School Administrators.

Written testimony has been submitted for this bill. The full

HB 2937 -- STUDENT OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP

SPONSOR: Davidson

This bill establishes the "Student Opportunity Savings Accounts
Program". The purpose of the Program is to provide direct payments
to "eligible pupils" for "qualified expenses" at an "approved
education entity" as those terms are defined in the bill.

The bill establishes two separate funds for the purposes of
distribution of the Constitutional requirement that 25% of general
revenue be allocated for education. The created funds are entitled
the "Student Opportunity Savings Accounts Program Fund" and the
"School District Per-Pupil Payments Fund". The bill requires that
8% of the allocation be distributed directly to the Classroom Trust
Fund established in Section 163.043 to supplement teacher salaries.

The remaining allocation will be distributed based on the pupil
data provided by the Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education to the State Treasurer who will use the pupil data to
calculate a per-pupil payment based on the total number of gifted,
special education, eligible pupils, and full-time and part-time
resident pupils. .

Eligible pupils participating in the Program will receive a
semiannual per pupil payment to the pupils individual student
opportunity savings account for qualified education expenses.
Money remaining in the pupil's account will remain and upon
graduation may be used for costs related to higher education, trade
school, or an in-State first home purchase.

Disbursement of per pupil payments by the treasurer's office will
occur on a monthly basis to school districts and charter schools
for any students that attend their resident school district or
charter school and are not enrolled in the program. Such per pupil
payment amounts will be based on enrollment and weighted for
special education and gifted pupils.

Pupils enrolled in the Program must take an annual State approved
pupil assessment to satisfy Federal requirements. Requirements for
educational entities to be determined a qualified school are
specified in the bill (Section 163.431 RSMo.).

This bill modifies Section 167.037 by removing requirements related
to "home school" and creates Section 167.012 with the term "home
school" defined. This Section prohibits home school students from
participation in the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Program under
Sections 166.700 to 166.720 and the Student Opportunity Savings
Account Program created under Section 163.431. The requirements
for homes school children remain the same as current statutory
requirements and include proof of 1000 hours of regular instruction
(Section 167.012).

The bill defines a "family-paced education school" and specifies
that students enrolled in a family-paced education school may
participate in both the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Program
and the Student Opportunity Savings Account Program. The
requirements for family-paced education school children are the
same as for home school students with proof of 1000 hours of
regular instruction and a daily log requirement (Section 167.013).

This bill modifies current statutes relating to home schools and
family-paced education schools for compulsory attendance under
Section 167.031, child-care facilities under Section 210.211, and
custody issues under Section 452.375.

S.B. 1051: Allows the enrollment of nonresident students in public school districts
############################
***********
graduation graduation
***********
Current Bill Summary SB 1051 - This act establishes provisions allowing enrollment of nonresident students in public school districts and modifies provisions regarding transportation costs for certain school districts. This act is similar to SB 5 (2023). MAGNET SCHOOLS (Section 163.161) Under this act, any school district that operates magnet schools as part of a master desegregation settlement agreement shall not be considered inefficient for purposes of state aid for transportation of pupils attending such magnet schools and shall not receive a financial penalty for the magnet school transportation portion of the overall transportation budget. This provision is identical to provisions in HCS/SS#2/SCS/SBs 4, 42, & 89 (2023), in SB 5 (2023), in HCS/HB 253 (2023), HB 672 (2023), and a provision in SB 1010 (2022). PUBLIC SCHOOL OPEN ENROLLMENT ACT (Sections 167.1200 to 167.1230) The act establishes the "Public School Open Enrollment Act" to enable students to transfer from their district of residence ("resident district") to a nonresident district. The Act shall become effective on July 1, 2025. These provisions are similar to provisions in SB 5 (2023) and to SB 1010 (2022), HCS/HB 253 (2023), HB 1814 (2022), and HS/HCS/HB 543 (2021). TRANSFER POLICY AND PARTICIPATION (Section 167.1205) On or before October 1st of each year, each school district and charter school shall indicate whether it will participate in the open enrollment program during the subsequent school year. Participating districts and schools may accept transferring nonresident students from any other school district. For the 2025-26 and 2026-27 school years, a district may restrict the number of students who may transfer away from the school district to a maximum of 5% of the district's enrollment for the prior year. The act shall not be construed to require any school to add teachers, staff, or classrooms. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education shall develop a model policy for districts and charter schools to determine such standards and the number of transfers they may accept. The model policy shall be adopted by all districts and charter schools, whether or not they participate in the program, and may be modified to meet each district's or charter school's particular needs. The model policy shall require each district or charter school to define "insufficient classroom space" and may provide additional standards for evaluating transfer applications. Nonresident districts shall accept credits toward graduation from other districts and shall award a diploma to any transferring student who meets the nonresident district's graduation requirements. Superintendents shall cause information regarding the open enrollment program to be posted on the school district's or charter school's website and in the district's or charter school's student handbook. A student seeking to transfer to a magnet school, an academically selective school, or a school with a competitive entrance process shall submit proof that the student meets all admission requirements. A student may be denied transfer if, in the most recent school year, he or she has been suspended from school two or more times, was suspended for an act of school violence, or expelled for acts that school administrators are required to report to law enforcement under current law. Such student may alternatively be permitted to transfer on a provisional, probationary basis subject to no further disruptive behavior based on standards that shall be developed by the nonresident district. Students denied transfer shall have the right to an in-person meeting with the nonresident district's superintendent. A 9th to 12th grade transfer student shall be ineligible to participate in varsity sports during the first 365 days of such student's enrollment, unless the student meets certain conditions as provided in the act. A statewide activities association may provide additional penalties if the student was unduly influenced to transfer for reasons related to participation in sports. APPLYING FOR TRANSFER (Section 167.1210) Students may transfer into only one nonresident district per school year. Transferring students shall commit to attending and taking all courses through the nonresident district for at least one school year, and at least one such course shall be in-seat. Students who transfer back to their resident districts shall reapply in order to transfer back into a nonresident district and shall first remain in the resident district for at least one full semester. Siblings of transferring students may also enroll in the same nonresident district to which their sibling transfers, subject to limitations based on school capacity and the student's disciplinary record. Except for students who qualify for reimbursement of transportation costs as described in the act and for agreements allowing such students to be picked up at an existing bus stop, transferring students or their parents shall be responsible for transportation to and from nonresident districts. By agreement with the nonresident district, parents of transferring students may waive requirements for such district to provide transportation required under the student's individualized education program. Any student who qualifies for free and reduced price lunch and transfers to an adjacent school district or charter school shall be reimbursed quarterly by the Parent Public School Choice Fund established in this act, based on calculations described in the act. PARENT PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE FUNDS (Sections 167.1211 and 167.1212) Nonresident districts shall receive reimbursement for the costs of certain special educational services for transferring students. Such reimbursement shall not exceed the district's current expenditure per average daily attendance. The reimbursement shall come from the Parent Public School Choice Fund established in the act. The Fund shall consist of an appropriation of $60 million and any subsequent appropriations. The Department shall annually evaluate the availability and use of moneys from the fund. If additional moneys are needed to fulfill the purposes of the act, the Department shall request such moneys by a specific line item appropriation. NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS (Section 167.1215) By October 1st annually, each school district and charter school shall set the number of transferring students such district or charter school is willing to accept for the following school year. The district or charter school may set criteria, including limits on the number of students to be accepted to particular buildings, grades, classrooms, or programs. Districts and charter schools shall publish and notify the Department of such information. Each district and charter school shall develop a procedure for creating a waiting list for all transfer applications when applications exceed the district's or charter school's maximum. In accepting students from the waiting list, nonresident districts shall give additional priority to students in the following order: siblings of transfer students, children of active duty military personnel, children of district or charter school employees, students who previously attended school in the district or charter school as resident students, and students whose parents' employment circumstances would cause transfer to be in the student's best interest. Nonresident districts may also include other priority factors. Parents of applicants shall be informed of how the waiting list shall operate and may be required to reapply to remain on the waiting list. APPLICATION PROCESS (Section 167.1220) A student's transfer application shall be submitted to the nonresident and resident districts on a form approved by the Department before December 1st in the year prior to the school year in which the student seeks to transfer. Nonresident districts shall mark the date and time of receipt on each such application. Applications shall be reviewed and decided upon by the superintendent. Reasons for any rejection shall be submitted to the school board or charter school governing body for review. Rejection decisions may be finalized only by a majority vote of the board or governing body. School boards and governing bodies of charter schools may adopt a policy granting the superintendent authority to approve transfer applications submitted after the December 1st deadline if conditions described in the act are met, including a finding of good cause. The act provides additional procedures related to the timing of late applications. Resident districts may appeal the decisions of nonresident districts for suspected violations of the late application provisions of the act. The Commissioner of Education or a three member panel selected by the Missouri Charter Public School Commission shall mediate such disputes and shall conduct a hearing if the mediation is unsuccessful. A decision shall be issued within 10 days of such hearing and may be appealed within 5 days. The superintendents of nonresident districts shall notify the parents of transfer applicants by February 1st whether the application has been accepted or rejected. Such notice shall include, if the application is rejected, the reason for a rejection, or, if the application is accepted, an enrollment deadline and instructions for renewing the transfer enrollment. AUTHORIZED EXEMPTIONS (Section 167.1225) The provisions of the Public School Open Enrollment Act shall not supercede any provision of an enforceable desegregation court order or a court-approved desegregation plan. A school district may declare an exemption from the Act if the district is subject to such an order or desegregation plan, or if the district is subject to a settlement agreement to remedy past segregation. Such exemption is irrevocable for one year from the date the district gives notice to the Department. Notice of a district's exemption or intent to resume participation in open enrollment for the next school year shall be issued to the Department by April 1st. By June 1st of each year, the Department shall report to each school district the maximum number of transfers under the Public School Open Enrollment Act for the next school year. When students are unable to transfer due to an exemption declared by a school district due to a court order, desegregation plan, or segregation-related settlement agreement, such students shall be given priority for any transfers in the subsequent school year by the resident district in the order application notices were received from such students. A school district with an approved or voluntary diversity plan may deny an Public School Open Enrollment Act transfer if the district determines that such transfer conflicts with such plan. Such denials shall be deemed to be made in good faith. Students transferring to nonresident districts pursuant to provisions of current law allowing transfer if the resident district does not offer high school instruction, under the Elementary and Secondary School District Enrollment Option Act, or through the Metropolitan Schools Achieving Value in Transfer Corporation, shall not be subject to the requirements of the Open Enrollment Act. School districts participating in such programs shall also not be subject to such requirements. Students transferring pursuant to the Open Enrollment Act shall not be considered transfer students for purposes of other provisions of current law allowing transfer. APPEAL PROCEDURE (Section 167.1230) Transfer applicants who are rejected may file an appeal with the Department or a three member panel selected by the Missouri Charter Public School Commission. The appeal shall be sent in writing within 10 business days after the student or the student's parent receives notice of rejection. A copy shall also be sent to the superintendent of the nonresident district where the applicant seeks to transfer. The appeal shall state the basis for appeal, shall include a copy of the notice of rejection, and may include documentation to show that transfer would be in the student's best interest. The nonresident district may submit additional documentation or arguments supporting the rejection decision to the Department or the three member panel, and shall submit copies of any such response to the student or student's parent, no later than 10 days after receiving a copy of the appeal. The Department or the three member panel shall notify the parent, nonresident district, and resident district of the basis for the Department's or panel's decision if it overturns the rejection. The Department shall collect data from school districts and each charter school sponsor shall collect data from each sponsored charter school on the number of applications made under the act to study its effects. The Department shall consider the maximum number of transfers and exemptions for up to two years to determine whether a significant racially segregative impact has occurred in any district. Before October 1st of each year, the Department and each charter school sponsor shall report its findings to the Joint Committee on Education, the House Committee on Elementary and Secondary Education, the Senate Committee on Education, and any other education committee designated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President Pro Tempore of the Senate.

H.B. 2147: Changes provisions governing the statewide assessment system
############################
***********
graduation
***********
HB 2147 -- STUDENT ASSESSMENT

SPONSOR: Henderson

This bill modifies language relating to the statewide assessment
system by requiring that the State Board of Education (SBE) make
the system student-centered and use assessments across the school
year that support teaching, learning, and program improvement, so
that a summative profile is developed of the student's learning.

The bill requires the SBE to select an assessment that meets the
federal requirements under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)
and the assessment may only be used to ensure compliance. The
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) is also
required to apply for a waiver of the (ESSA) testing requirements.

The requirements for the assessment are described in the bill and
include that it show student skill evolution, measure growth during
and across years, and provide multiple opportunities for students
to show proficiency.

The bill also requires the SBE to adopt a statewide accountability
system for public schools including virtual schools that will
annually measure academic achievement, progress in elementary
schools, graduation rate for high schools and school quality or
student success. The current school accountability report card
will be transitioned to an accountability dashboard beginning in
the 2024-25 school year.

Beginning in the 2025-26 school year and in each subsequent year
the school accountability report card must provide each student's
grade-level equivalence as measured on the statewide assessment.

Data relating to the grade-level equivalence must be searchable on
a building-by-building, school-by-school, district-by-district, and
statewide level. Such data must display a percentage of students
that are at grade level or above for each level, provided that no
data will disclose personal identification of any student except to
a student's parent.

The bill requires the SBE to identify and recognize by July 1,
2025, a minimum of two national school accreditation agencies and
beginning in the 2027-28 school year allow for districts that have
an accreditation from either of the national agencies to be
considered fully accredited for state purposes.

The bill modifies provisions of the School Turnaround Program to
reflect updates to the state accountability system and to provide
comprehensive support and improvement schools or targeted support
and improvement schools with assistance.

This bill is similar to HCS HB 49 (2023).

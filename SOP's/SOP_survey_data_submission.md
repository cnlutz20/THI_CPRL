# SOP: Submitting Survey Data via Form

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for submitting survey data using the provided form template. 

## Template Overview

The survey data should be entered into a template with the following columns:

- **Respondent**: The name of the person being surveyed.
- **Question Columns**: Each column represents a survey question (replace the placeholder `question_1`, `question_2`, ..., `question_n` with the actual question titles from the survey).
- **Values**: The answers provided by the respondent should be listed in the corresponding question columns.

### Example Template Structure

| Respondent   | Question 1   | Question 2   | ... | Question N   |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----|--------------|
| Respondent A | Answer 1A    | Answer 2A    | ... | Answer NA    |
| Respondent B | Answer 1B    | Answer 2B    | ... | Answer NB    |
| ...          | ...          | ...          | ... | ...          |

## Steps for Completing the Template

1. **Open the template**: Ensure you are using the correct form template that includes the relevant columns for each survey question.
   
2. **Fill in the respondent's name**: 
   - In the **Respondent** column, enter the full name of the surveyee.
   
3. **Replace column headers with question titles**: 
   - Replace the placeholder `question_1`, `question_2`, ..., `question_n` with the corresponding survey question titles.
   
4. **Enter responses**:
   - For each respondent, enter their answers to the survey questions in the appropriate columns.
   - Ensure that all data entered is accurate and corresponds to the correct respondent.

5. **Review and submit**:
   - Double-check all entries for accuracy.

## Important Notes

By following these steps, staff can ensure accurate and organized submission of survey data.

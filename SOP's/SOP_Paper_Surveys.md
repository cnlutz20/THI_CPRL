Check Completeness: Ensure all surveys are complete and legible. Remove any surveys that are damaged or unusable.
Organize Surveys: Sort surveys by type or session to streamline data entry.
### 5.3 Digitization Process


Scanning:
Use a scanner or a mobile app to digitize each paper survey.
Save scanned files in a designated folder on your computer.
Choose a file format (e.g., PDF, JPG) that maintains clarity.
<br>
Data Entry:
Open the digitized survey in your data entry software.
Input responses accurately, following the survey structure.
Use drop-down lists or checkboxes for standardized responses to minimize errors.

### 5.4 Data Cleaning
Review the entered data for accuracy.
Correct any discrepancies or errors found during the review.
Remove duplicates if applicable.
### 5.5 Data Submission 
Save the finalized dataset in an accessible and secure location.
Back up the data regularly (e.g., weekly) to prevent loss.
### 5.6 Analyzing Data 
Prepare the data for analysis based on event objectives.
Use appropriate statistical methods and tools to analyze responses.
### 5.7 Reporting Results 
Compile the findings into a report or presentation.
Share the results with relevant stakeholders in a timely manner.
## 6. Considerations for Digitizing Paper Surveys 
Legibility: Ensure that handwriting is clear and easily readable to avoid misinterpretation.
Data Privacy: Protect sensitive information in compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
Format Consistency: Maintain consistency in how data is entered to facilitate analysis (e.g., use the same units or scales).
Training: Provide training for personnel on how to digitize and enter data accurately.
Feedback Loop: Implement a process for staff to report issues or suggest improvements to the digitization process.
## 7. Review and Revisions 
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate improvements or changes in technology.
